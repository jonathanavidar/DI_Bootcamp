// EXERCISE 2

let people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

list1=people.shift(0) && people.pop() && people.push("Jason", "Jonathan");


console.log(list1)

while(list1[i] = "Jason"){
    // if (people != "Jason"){
        break;
    }

console.log(list1[i]);





// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and after you console.log “Jason” exit the loop.
// Write code to make a copy of the people array using slice. The copy should NOT include “Mary” or your name.
// Write code that console.logs Mary’s index. take a look at indexOf on google.
// Write code that gives the indexOf “Foo” (this should return -1). Why does it return -1
// Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
// Hint: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the length of the array?
